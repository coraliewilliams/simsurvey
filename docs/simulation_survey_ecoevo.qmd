# Background

Simulation studies hold a central role in evaluating statistical methodologies. Conducting a simulation study is an in-silico experiment, where the underlying process of generating the data is known, and the statistical performance can be assessed under diverse scenarios. Here, we present the findings from a survey of 100 research articles in ecology and evolutionary biology journals that use at least one simulation study to evaluate statistical methods.

A framework called ADEMP (Aims, Data-generating mechanisms, Methods, Estimand/statistical target, Performance measures) was introduced by Morris et al. (2019, Stat Med, 38, p2074), and provides key steps to plan, code, analyse, and report simulation studies.

Using the ADEMP framework as a basis, we put together a list of reporting items to characterise and assess the reporting practices of simulation studies. Our results provide an overview of the current state of simulation studies in ecology and evolutionary biology.

# Objectives

Using the ADEMP+ framework we will:

-   Survey the characteristics of simulation studies evaluating statistical methodologies in ecology and evolutionary biology.

-   Assess the reporting practices of simulation studies evaluating statistical methodologies in ecology and evolutionary biology.

```{r journalList, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Load journal lists
jcr_stats <- read_csv("data/JCR/JCR_JournalResults_09_2022_Statistics_and_Probability.csv", skip = 2)

jcr_evo <- read_csv("data/JCR/JCR_JournalResults_09_2022_Evolutionary_Biology.csv", skip = 2)

# Clean: delete empty rows and comment lines at the end of files
jcr_stats <- jcr_stats[which(!is.na(jcr_stats$ISSN)),]
jcr_eco <- jcr_eco[which(!is.na(jcr_eco$ISSN)),]

# Check how many journals overlap between each journal group: none with stats journal list, and 18 journals between eco and evo
stats_in_eco <- jcr_stats[which(jcr_stats$`Journal name` %in% jcr_eco$`Journal name`),]
stats_in_evo <- jcr_stats[which(jcr_stats$`Journal name` %in% jcr_evo$`Journal name`),]

# get concatenated list of eco + evo journal lists
ecoevo <- rbind(jcr_eco, jcr_evo)

############
# IMPORTANT: modified merge() code below as of 20/09/2023, before this code was merging on all columns and only matched 15 journals and missed 3 journals that were overlapping.
###########
# get list of matching and unique journals in eco and evo groups
ecoevo_match <- merge(jcr_eco, jcr_evo, by="Journal name")
ecoevo_match$Category <- "Both"
ecoevo_notmatch <- ecoevo[which(!ecoevo$`Journal name` %in% ecoevo_match$`Journal name`),]




# get merged list of journals from eco and evo
ecoevo_merged <- rbind(ecoevo_match, ecoevo_notmatch)

# save results
write_csv(ecoevo_merged, "ecoevo_jcr_journal_list.csv", na="")

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

-   Include publications between 01-01-2012 and 01-09-2022.
-   Include studies using simulation for the evaluation of statistical methodologies. Simulation studies that are not assessing methods in statistics will be excluded (for example simulation studies to assess ecological theories: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.02.007>).
-   Simulation studies that are part of a review, commentary, letter to the editor or tutorial will be excluded (for example: <https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.1380>) Included studies published in one of predefined journals in Table 1.
-   Include if: Full text is available and full text is in English
