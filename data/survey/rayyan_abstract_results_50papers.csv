However, there are few studies on the impact of soft data on APEX model outputs.This study sought to determine the impact of soft data (i.e., crop yields, evapotranspiration [ET], and drainage) used to constrain calibration on APEX model to simulate outputs (streamflow, total nitrogen [TN], and total phosphorus [TP] losses), as well as the impact of tile drainage on the model outputs to help identify issues with APEX. Long-term measured water quality and quantity data from Rock Creek watershed, northern Ohio, were used for this purpose. Four calibration scenarios were used: (A) streamflow statistics only, (B) streamflow statistics plus soft data, (C) streamflow plus water quality, and (D) streamflow plus water quality plus yields plus soft criteria.The number of parameter sets that meet the criteria decreased from 3,325 to 2, as the number of calibration criteria increased. In general, when soft data were used to constrain the model, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values decreased for all components. For example, NSE for streamflow decreased from 0.79 for scenario A to 0.56 for scenario B when the soft data were used, and NSE for TP decreased from 0.34 for scenario C to 0.30 for scenario D. However, the scenarios that used soft data with lower NSE values simulated the biophysical processes more accurately. For all calibration/validation scenarios, streamflow,TN, and TP values were drastically reduced when the model was run without tile drainage. However, there was hardly any tile drainage impact on ET, surface runoff, or crop yields for all scenarios, indicating that improvements in tile drainage, water table, and crop growth routines may be needed. Overall, the results show the importance of constraining the model parameters to produce reasonable values of crop yield and water balance closure to obtain realistic simulations of various management practices.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  65 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not statistical method",10.2489/jswc.73.6.623     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX);performance measures;Rock Creek;tile drainage;CONSERVATION EFFECTS ASSESSMENT;EFFECTS ASSESSMENT PROJECT;NUTRIENT TRACKING TOOL;WATER-QUALITY;APEX MODEL;POLICY/ENVIRONMENTAL EXTENDER;SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE;LAKE-ERIE;PERFORMANCE;STREAMFLOW;Calibration,,

Researchers typically sum over the straight-line displacements (SLDs) between sampled locations to quantify distance traveled, while speed is estimated by dividing these displacements by time. Problematically, this approach is highly sensitive to the measurement scale, with biases subject to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal's movement, and the amount of measurement error. Compounding the issue of scale-sensitivity, SLD estimates do not come equipped with confidence intervals to quantify their uncertainty. Methods To overcome the limitations of SLD estimation, we outline a continuous-time speed and distance (CTSD) estimation method. An inherent property of working in continuous-time is the ability to separate the underlying continuous-time movement process from the discrete-time sampling process, making these models less sensitive to the sampling schedule when estimating parameters. The first step of CTSD is to estimate the device's error parameters to calibrate the measurement error. Once the errors have been calibrated, model selection techniques are employed to identify the best fit continuous-time movement model for the data. A simulation-based approach is then employed to sample from the distribution of trajectories conditional on the data, from which the mean speed estimate and its confidence intervals can be extracted. Results Using simulated data, we demonstrate how CTSD provides accurate, scale-insensitive estimates with reliable confidence intervals. When applied to empirical GPS data, we found that SLD estimates varied substantially with sampling frequency, whereas CTSD provided relatively consistent estimates, with often dramatic improvements over SLD. Conclusions The methods described in this study allow for the computationally efficient, scale-insensitive estimation of speed and distance traveled, without biases due to the sampling frequency, the tortuosity of the animal's movement, or the amount of measurement error. In addition to being robust to the sampling schedule, the point estimates come equipped with confidence intervals, permitting formal statistical inference.

In the frequentist approach, this is often achieved by using a Wald interval in which the standard error of the estimate of the function is obtained using the delta method. The purpose of this paper is to promote a simple alternative to the delta method that will provide better coverage properties when the estimates of the model parameters have a distribution that is approximately multivariate normal, as will be the case asymptotically for maximum likelihood estimates in regular models. We propose a simple diagnostic tool that can be used to assess the reliability of this assumption. The method we promote can be thought of as a computationally efficient version of parametric bootstrapping, as it mimics such bootstrapping without a need to refit the model. We provide two examples to illustrate use of the new method and present simulation results which show that its coverage properties are superior to those for a Wald interval based on the delta method when the assumption of normality for the estimates of the model parameters is reliable. We also compare its coverage properties and computational effort with those of parametric bootstrapping.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  26 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: included in survey",10.1111/2041-210X.13848,bootstrap;confidence interval;delta method;nonlinear function;simulation;zero-inflated model;CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS;ABUNDANCE,,

We used the results of the review in a simulation experiment to assess the performance of conventional frequentist and Bayesian meta-analysis methods for estimating a mean effect size and its uncertainty interval. Our literature review showed thatn(i)andkwere highly variable, distributions were right-skewed and were generally small (mediann(i) = 5, mediank = 44).

Whenkwas low (<40), 95% coverage was achieved by a confidence interval (CI) based on thetdistribution that uses an adjusted standard error (the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman, HKSJ), or by a Bayesian credible interval, whereas bootstrap orzdistribution CIs had lower coverage. Despite the importance of the method to calculate the uncertainty interval, 39% of the meta-analyses reviewed did not report the method used, and of the 61% that did, 94% used a potentially problematic method, which may be a consequence of software defaults. In general, for a simple random-effects meta-analysis, the performance of the best frequentist and Bayesian methods was similar for the same combinations of factors (kand mean replication), though the Bayesian approach had higher than nominal (>95%) coverage for the mean effect whenkwas very low (k < 15). Our literature review suggests that many meta-analyses that usedzdistribution or bootstrapping CIs may have overestimated the statistical significance of their results when the number of studies was low; more appropriate methods need to be adopted in ecological meta-analyses.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  18     Total Times Cited:  18     Cited Reference Count:  41 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: included in survey",10.1111/2041-210X.13445,bias;confidence interval;coverage;credible interval;effect size;global climate change;log response ratio;sample size;CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS;EFFECT SIZE;HETEROGENEITY;VARIANCE;MODELS;TESTS,,

However, the labour required to sample numerous individuals and subsequently handle each sample renders the quantification of rare mutations (e.g., pesticide resistance gene mutations at the early stages of resistance development) challenging. Meanwhile, pooling DNA from multiple individuals as a ""bulk sample"" combined with qPCR may reduce handling costs. The qPCR output for a bulk sample, however, contains uncertainty owing to variations in DNA yields from each individual, in addition to measurement errors. In this study, we have developed a statistical model to estimate the frequency of the specific allele and its confidence interval when the sample allele frequencies are obtained in the form of Delta Delta Cq in the qPCR analyses on multiple bulk samples collected from a population. We assumed a gamma distribution as the individual DNA yield and developed an R package for parameter estimation, which was verified using real DNA samples from acaricide-resistant spider mites, as well as a numerical simulation. Our model resulted in unbiased point estimates of the allele frequency compared with simple averaging of the Delta Delta Cq values. The confidence intervals suggest that dividing the bulk samples into more parts will improve precision if the total number of individuals is equal; however, if the cost of PCR analysis is higher than that of sampling, increasing the total number and pooling them into a few bulk samples may also yield comparable precision.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: genomic",10.1111/1755-0998.13554,confidence interval;group testing;maximum-likelihood estimation;R language;real-time polymerase chain reaction;REAL-TIME PCR;INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE;MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTICS;CONSERVATION;SELECTION;STRATEGY;MUTATION;MODELS;Gene Frequency;Alleles,,

The application of ecological models can have real-world consequences that drive ecological theory development and science-based decision and policy making, so it is imperative that the conclusions drawn from ecological models have a strong, credible quantitative basis. In particular it is important to establish whether any predicted change in a model output has ecological and statistical significance. Ecological models may include stochastic components, using probability distributions to represent some modeled processes. An individual run of a stochastic ecological model is a random draw from an infinitely large population, requiring replicate simulations to estimate the distribution of model outcomes. An important consideration is the number of Monte Carlo replicates necessary to draw useful conclusions from the model analysis. A simple framework is presented that borrows from well-understood techniques for experimental design, including confidence interval estimation and sample size power analysis. The desired precision of interval estimates for model prediction, or the minimum desired detectable effect size between scenarios, is established by the researcher in the context of the model objectives and the ecological system. The number of replicates required to achieve that level of precision or detectable effect is computed given an estimate of the variability in the model outcomes of interest. If the number of replicates is computationally prohibitive, then the expected precision or detectable effect for that sample size should be reported. An example is given for a stochastic model of fire spread integrated with an eco-hydrological model.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  6     Total Times Cited:  6     Cited Reference Count:  14 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: review/recommendations",10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.12.022     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Stochastic simulation;Confidence interval;Prediction interval;Inference;Estimation;Research Design,,

The second submodel explicitly represents the redox transformations of N that lead to N2O production (nitrification and hypoxic denitrification) and N2O consumption (suboxic denitrification), and is presented here for the first time. We perturb both submodels by modifying the key parameters of the N2O cycling pathways (nitrification rates; NH4+ uptake; N2O yields under oxic, hypoxic and suboxic conditions) and determine a set of optimal model parameters by minimisation of a cost function against four databases of N cycle observations.

Typically, the discrimination capacity of the models, that is, how good the instances of presence and absence are correctly classified, is assessed with statistics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). However, the value of any discrimination statistic depends on the distribution of the suitability scores in the evaluation dataset, the so-called representativeness effect. For example, the same well-calibrated model evaluated with two datasets, one set with mostly intermediate predicted values (around 0.5) and another set in which most cases have extreme predicted values (close to 0 and close to 1), will yield low (towards 0.5) and high (towards 1) AUC values, respectively. Thus, discrimination values are entirely context dependent and cannot be directly compare between datasets because they are not intrinsic measures of a model's performance. In this contribution, I propose a methodology based on stratified bootstrapping with an inverse probability weighting that makes the distribution of the suitability values uniform and harmonizes the AUC so that the so-called uAUC can now be compared between different datasets. I run simulations considering a range of sample sizes and different initial distributions of the suitability values to validate the method. I apply the method to an empirical exercise, and implement it in the R package vandalico. Although I mainly focused on the AUC, the harmonization procedure can be applied to any other discrimination measure that is prevalence independent in a strict mathematical sense, such as the sensitivity star (Se*). To provide accurate estimations, it is important to have a high-quality evaluation dataset, that is, a dataset that covers the whole spectrum of suitability values and a minimum sample size of at least 150 cases. Further research is needed to develop a method to estimate reliable confidence intervals. I expect the harmonization methodology proposed here to be of interest in other research areas (besides ecology) that deal with discrimination/classification problems.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  2     Total Times Cited:  2     Cited Reference Count:  90 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: included in survey",10.1111/2041-210X.13826,AUC;comparability;discrimination;harmonization;representativeness effect;sensitivity star;species distribution modelling;SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS;PREDICTIVE PERFORMANCE;CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS;ROC ANALYSIS;AREA;PREVALENCE;NICHE;DISCRIMINATION;DISTRIBUTIONS;ACCURACY;Area Under Curve,,

Based on simulations, we illustrate some of the underlying motivations. First, p-values vary strongly from study to study, hence dichotomous inference using significance thresholds is usually unjustified. Second, 'statistically significant' results have overestimated effect sizes, a bias declining with increasing statistical power. Third, 'statistically non-significant' results have underestimated effect sizes, and this bias gets stronger with higher statistical power. Fourth, the tested statistical hypotheses usually lack biological justification and are often uninformative. Despite these problems, a screen of 48 papers from the 2020 volume of the Journal of Evolutionary Biology exemplifies that significance testing is still used almost universally in evolutionary biology. All screened studies tested default null hypotheses of zero effect with the default significance threshold of p = 0.05, none presented a pre-specified alternative hypothesis, pre-study power calculation and the probability of 'false negatives' (beta error rate). The results sections of the papers presented 49 significance tests on average (median 23, range 0-390). Of 41 studies that contained verbal descriptions of a 'statistically non-significant' result, 26 (63%) falsely claimed the absence of an effect. We conclude that studies in ecology and evolutionary biology are mostly exploratory and descriptive. We should thus shift from claiming to 'test' specific hypotheses statistically to describing and discussing many hypotheses (possible true effect sizes) that are most compatible with our data, given our statistical model. We already have the means for doing so, because we routinely present compatibility ('confidence') intervals covering these hypotheses.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  87 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/jeb.14009,compatibility interval;effect size;null hypothesis;p-value;scientific method;statistical inference;STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE;CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS;P-VALUES;POWER CALCULATIONS;SCIENCE;NULL;HYPOTHESIS;ECOLOGY;CRISIS;METAANALYSIS,,

The posterior distribution for extinction time is evaluated using the likelihood of sighting data and non-informative priors for model parameters. All the models discussed in this paper are implemented in JAGS, a program for analysing Bayesian models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. A general methodology is presented and then applied to the sighting record of the ivory-billed woodpecker (IBW)Campephilus principalis. It was found that the IBW most likely went extinct between 1940 and 1945, a little after the date of the last certain sighting. The methods developed were also applied to other species sighting records as well as some artificial sighting records. Through the results, it was found that the inferred time of extinction is significantly influenced by the last certain sighting if the sighting record consists of only certain sightings. In the presence of uncertain sightings, the inferred extinction time is influenced by either the last certain sighting or the time when the uncertain sighting rate drops.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  3     Total Times Cited:  3     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a simulation study",10.1111/2041-210X.13408,Bayesian modelling;extinction probability;highest posterior density interval;Markov Chain Monte Carlo;sighting record;uncertain sightings;CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS;UNCERTAIN SIGHTINGS;INFERENCE;RECORDS,,

We need to improve our capabilities to assess richness trends using datasets collected in unstandardized procedures with potential collection bias. Two methods are proposed and applied to estimate richness change, which both incorporate models for sampling effects and detection probability: (a) nonlinear species accumulation curves with an error variance model and (b) Pradel capture-recapture models. The methods are used to assess nationwide temporal trends (1945-2018) in the species richness of wild bees in the Netherlands. Previously, a decelerating decline in wild bee species richness was inferred for part of this dataset. Among the species accumulation curves, those with nonconstant changes in species richness are preferred. However, when analyzing data subsets, constant changes became selected for non-Bombus bees (for samples in collections) and bumblebees (for spatial grid cells sampled in three periods). Smaller richness declines are predicted for non-Bombus bees than bumblebees. However, when relative losses are calculated from confidence intervals limits, they overlap and touch zero loss. Capture-recapture analysis applied to species encounter histories infers a constant colonization rate per year and constant local species survival for bumblebees and other bees. This approach predicts a 6% reduction in non-Bombus species richness from 1945 to 2018 and a significant 19% reduction for bumblebees.

Presence/absence (P/A) sampling may have advantages over plant cover assessments for reducing such errors. However, the linking between P/A data and plant density depends on model assumptions for plant spatial distributions. Previous studies have shown, for example, how that plant density can be estimated under Poisson model assumptions on the plant locations. In this study, new methods are developed and evaluated for linking P/A data with plant density assuming that plants occur in clustered spatial patterns.        New theory was derived for estimating plant density under Neyman-Scott-type cluster models such as the Matern and Thomas cluster processes. Suggested estimators, corresponding confidence intervals and a proposed goodness-of-fit test were evaluated in a Monte Carlo simulation study assuming a Matern cluster process. Furthermore, the estimators were applied to plant data from environmental monitoring in Sweden to demonstrate their empirical application.        The simulation study showed that our methods work well for large enough sample sizes. The judgment of what is' large enough' is often difficult, but simulations indicate that a sample size is large enough when the sampling distributions of the parameter estimators are symmetric or mildly skewed. Bootstrap may be used to check whether this is true. The empirical results suggest that the derived methodology may be useful for estimating density of plants such as Leucanthemum vulgare and Scorzonera humilis.        By developing estimators of plant density from P/A data under realistic model assumptions about plants' spatial distributions, P/A sampling will become a more useful tool for inventories of plant populations. Our new theory is an important step in this direction.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  49 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/2041-210X.13347,independent cluster process;intensity;Matern cluster process;plant monitoring;sample plots;spatial models;Thomas cluster process;vegetation survey;PARAMETER-ESTIMATION;SPATIAL STRUCTURE;VEGETATION;ABUNDANCE;EXPERIENCES,,

For species individual with spatial aggregation, individual-unit-based random sampling scheme is difficult to implement, and quadrat-unit-based sampling scheme is more available to implement and more likely to fit the model assumption of random sampling. In addition, sample-based incidence data, without recording the number of individuals of a species and only recording the binary presence or absence of a species in the sampled unit, could considerably reduce the survey loading in the field. In this study, according to sample-based incidence data and based on a beta-binomial model assumption, instead of using the maximum likelihood method, I used the moment method to derive the richness estimator. The proposed richness estimation method provides a lower bound estimator of species richness for beta-binomial models, in which the new method only uses the number of singletons, doubletons and tripletons in the sample to estimate undetected richness. I evaluated the proposed estimator using simulated datasets generated from various species abundance models. For highly heterogeneous communities, the simulation results indicate that the proposed estimator could provide a more stable, less biased estimate and a more accurate 95% confidence interval of true richness compared to other traditional parametric-based estimators.

We developed a new approach to estimate population density based on the simulation of individual movement within the camera grid. Simulated animals followed a correlated random walk with the movement parameters of segment length, angular deflection, movement distance and home-range size derived from empirical movement paths. Movement was simulated under a series of population densities. We used the Random Forest algorithm to determine the population density with the highest likelihood of matching the camera trap data. We developed an R package, cameratrapR, to conduct simulations and estimate population density. 3. Compared with line transect surveys and the random encounter model, cameratrapR provides more reliable estimates of wildlife density with narrower confidence intervals.

This assumption influences management focused on simulation of natural disturbance dynamics and is embedded in most models of forest successional dynamics. We use multi-decade monitoring of permanent plots in old-growth forests to assess demographic assumptions directly with respect to tree mortality rates.        Location Sixteen sites in mesic, temperate old-growth forests in eastern North America and Europe with multi-decade monitoring.        Time period Variable across sites, spanning c. 20-78 years from 1936 to 2014.

Methods We calculated and compared the annualized mortality rates (m), with confidence intervals, by species, size class and measurement interval, for tree species of sufficient abundance.        Results Retrospective analysis shows dynamic and diverse demographic properties across populations and sites. Stand-scale mortality rates of 0.7-2.5%/year average higher than previous estimates for old-growth temperate forests. Variations among species, over time and among size classes, suggest that gap-phase models are inadequate to explain stand dynamics, implying instead that rare disturbance events of moderate severity have long-lasting effects in old-growth forests and that indirect anthropogenic influences affect old-growth, unlogged forests.        Main conclusions Multi-decade baseline data, essential for understanding community assembly and long-term dynamics in these ""slow systems,"" are rare and poorly integrated. Our analysis demonstrates the value of the few long-term, ""legacy"" data sets. Results suggest that differences in life history interact with complex disturbance histories, resulting in non-equilibrial dynamics in old-growth temperate tree communities, and that changes in disturbance patterns through anthropogenic climate change might, therefore, be an important driver of ecosystem change.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  108 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a simulation study",10.1111/geb.13291,long&#8208;term studies;old&#8208;growth forest;permanent plots;temperate forest;tree mortality rates;North America;Europe;Trees,,

For motile species, this 'upscaling' is governed by how well any given movement strategy maximizes encounters with positive factors and minimizes encounters with negative factors. Despite the importance of encounter events for a broad range of ecological processes, encounter theory has not kept pace with developments in animal tracking or movement modelling. Furthermore, existing work has focused primarily on the relationship between animal movement and encounter rates while the relationship between individual movement and the spatial locations of encounter events in the environment has remained conspicuously understudied.        Here, we bridge this gap by introducing a method for describing the long-term encounter location probabilities for movement within home ranges, termed the conditional distribution of encounters (CDE). We then derive this distribution, as well as confidence intervals, implement its statistical estimator into open-source software and demonstrate the broad ecological relevance of this distribution.        We first use simulated data to show how our estimator provides asymptotically consistent estimates. We then demonstrate the general utility of this method for three simulation-based scenarios that occur routinely in biological systems: (a) a population of individuals with home ranges that overlap with neighbours; (b) a pair of individuals with a hard territorial border between their home ranges; and (c) a predator with a large home range that encompassed the home ranges of multiple prey individuals. Using GPS data from white-faced capuchins Cebus capucinus, tracked on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and sleepy lizards Tiliqua rugosa, tracked in Bundey, South Australia, we then show how the CDE can be used to estimate the locations of territorial borders, identify key resources, quantify the potential for competitive or predatory interactions and/or identify any changes in behaviour that directly result from location-specific encounter probability.        The CDE enables researchers to better understand the dynamics of populations of interacting individuals. Notably, the general estimation framework developed in this work builds straightforwardly off of home range estimation and requires no specialized data collection protocols. This method is now openly available via the ctmm R package.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  11     Total Times Cited:  11     Cited Reference Count:  141 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not statistical method",10.1111/2041-210X.13597,animal movement;Cebus capucinus;contact;home range;interactions;Tiliqua rugosa;HOME-RANGE OVERLAP;TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR;CEBUS-CAPUCINUS;SLEEPY LIZARD;SPATIAL-ORGANIZATION;CAPUCHIN MONKEYS;DECISION-MAKING;ROAD MORTALITY;MOVEMENT;PATTERNS;Animal Shells;Animals,,

In particular, acoustic SCR models deal with detections of animal vocalisations across an array of acoustic detectors. Previously published acoustic SCR methods either estimate call density (calls per unit space per unit time) rather than animal density itself, require an independently estimated call rate to estimate animal density, or discard data from all but one detected call from each individual.        In this manuscript, we develop a new spatial capture-recapture model that estimates both call rate and animal density from the acoustic survey alone, without requiring an independently estimated call rate. Our approach therefore alleviates the need for the additional fieldwork of physically locating and monitoring individual animals. We illustrate our method and compare it to an existing approach using a simulation study and an application to data collected on an acoustic survey of the visually cryptic Cape peninsula moss frog Arthroleptella lightfooti.        In the context of our acoustic survey, our calling animal density estimator has low bias, good precision and confidence intervals with appropriate coverage, yielding results that are consistent with previous studies of the same species.        Our method can obtain accurate and precise estimates of animal density while eliminating the fieldwork burden associated with separately estimating call rate.

In reality, this is rarely the case - both antagonistic and gregarious relationships lead to non-independent spatial configurations, with territorial exclusion at one end of the spectrum and group-living at the other. Previous simulation studies suggest that grouping has limited impact on the outcome of SCR analyses. However, group associations entail not only spatial clustering of activity centers but also coordinated space use by group members, potentially impacting both ecological and observation processes underlying SCR analysis. We simulated SCR scenarios with different strengths of aggregation (clustering of individuals into groups with shared activity centers) and cohesion (synchronization of detection patterns of members of a group). We then fit SCR models to the simulated data sets and evaluated the effect of aggregation and cohesion on parameter estimates. Low to moderate aggregation and cohesion did not impact the bias and precision of estimates of density and the scale parameter of the detection function. However, non-independence between individuals led to high levels of overdispersion. Overdispersion strongly decreased the coverage of confidence intervals around parameter estimates, thereby increasing the probability of erroneous predictions. Our results indicate that SCR models are robust to moderate levels of aggregation and cohesion. Nonetheless, spatial dependence between individuals can lead to false inference. We recommend that practitioners 1) test for the presence of overdispersion in SCR data caused by aggregation and cohesion, and, if necessary, 2) correct their variance estimates using the overdispersion factor (c) over cap. Approaches for doing both are described in this paper. We also urge the development of SCR models that incorporate spatial associations between individuals not only to account for overdispersion but also to obtain quantitative information about social aspects of study populations.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  28     Total Times Cited:  28     Cited Reference Count:  38 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.2981/wlb.00649     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),aggregation;cohesion;coverage probability;grouping;overdispersion;population density;spatial capture-recapture;POPULATION;SURVIVAL;MODEL;HYPOTHESES;TESTS,,

In the first systematic effort at a large regional scale, we estimated the population of the elusive snow leopard Panthera uncia over an area of 26,112 km(2) in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. We stratified the entire snow leopard habitat in Himachal Pradesh based on an occupancy survey. Subsequently, we conducted camera trapping surveys at 10 sites distributed proportionately, that is with similar coverage probability across the three strata. We conducted simulations to understand how unidentified captures could affect our model estimate. We also assessed populations of the primary wild ungulate prey of snow leopards - blue sheep Pseudois nayaur and Siberian ibex Capra sibirica. Our results yielded a mean estimated density of 0.19 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12-0.31) snow leopards per 100 km(2) and population size of 51 (95% CI: 34-73) snow leopards in Himachal Pradesh. The density estimates for individual sites ranged from 0.08 to 0.37 snow leopards per 100 km(2). Simulations showed that unidentified snow leopard captures did not seem to affect the accuracy of our model estimate but could have affected the precision. Wild ungulate prey density ranged from 0.11 to 1.09 per km(2). Snow leopard density showed a positive linear relationship with prey density (slope = 0.25, SE = 0.08, P = 0.01, R-2 = 0.51). Our study shows the earlier opinion-based estimate for Himachal Pradesh to have been significantly positively biased. Using occupancy surveys to stratify large areas in order to design camera trap surveys addresses one of the common spatial sampling biases, that is limited sampling of only prime snow leopard habitats. Our work validates two-step approach recommended in the ongoing initiative of the 12 snow leopard range countries for Population Assessment of World's Snow leopards (PAWS program), and cautions against the use of opinion-based estimates for assessing the status of species of critical conservation importance.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  8     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  43 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a simulation study",10.1002/2688-8319.12115     WE  - Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),camera trap;density estimation;India;Panthera uncia;population size;Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture;ungulate prey density;PANTHERA-UNCIA;ABUNDANCE,,

First, the primary articles in these fields usually report results that are observed from studies conducted with different species, and the phylogeny among the species violates the independence assumption. Second, articles frequently allow the computation of multiple effect sizes which cannot be accounted for by conventional meta-analytic models. While both issues can be dealt with by utilizing a multilevel model that accounts for phylogeny, the performance of such a model has not been examined extensively. In this article, we investigate the performance of this model in comparison with some simpler models. We conducted an extensive simulation study where data with different hierarchical structures (in terms of study and species levels) were generated and then various models were fitted to examine their performance. The models we used include the conventional random effects and multilevel random-effects models along with more complex multilevel models that account for species-level variance with different variance components. Furthermore, we present an illustrative application of these models based on the data from a meta-analysis on sizeassortative mating and comment on the results in light of the findings from the simulation study. Our simulation results show that, when the phylogenetic relationships among the species are at least moderately strong, only the most complex model that decomposes the species-level variance into nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic components provides approximately unbiased estimates of the overall mean and variance components and yields confidence intervals with an approximately nominal coverage rate. Contrarily, removing the phylogenetic or non-phylogenetic component leads to biased variance component estimates and an increased risk for incorrect inferences about the overall mean. These findings are supported by the results derived from the illustrative application. Based on our results, we suggest that meta-analyses in ecology and evolution should use the model that accounts for both the nonphylogenetic and phylogenetic species-level variance in addition to the multilevel structure of the data. Any attempts to simplify this model, such as using only the phylogenetic variance component, may lead to erroneous inferences from the data.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  21     Total Times Cited:  21     Cited Reference Count:  46 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/2041-210X.13760,comparative analysis < evolutionary biology;mixed-effects models;model efficiency;multilevel models;phylogenetic meta-analysis;random-effects variance estimation;EFFECT SIZE;INFORMATION;VARIANCE,,

Rao's spacing test is often used to evaluate the support the data offers for the null hypothesis of uniformity. Here we demonstrate that the traditional version of this test fails to adequately control type I error rate when the data is non-continuous (i.e. is rounded/grouped to a finite number of discrete values, e.g. to the nearest degree, a common situation). To overcome this issue, we provide a numerically-intensive simulation version of the test.        Methods: We use a simulation study to explore the performance of the traditional and our novel variant on Rao's spacing test, both in terms of control of type I error rate and statistical power.        Results: When data is measured on a continuous circular scale then both methods offer good control of type I error and similar statistical power. If the data is rounded (even to a relatively fine scale such as to the nearest degree - giving 360 possible values), however, the traditional method produces highly inflated type I error rates, particularly with high sample sizes, that make it inappropriate for application to such data. In contrast, our simulation method retains good control of type I error while offering levels of statistical power similar to the traditional Rao test.        Conclusions: The traditional method of applying Rao's spacing test should be replaced by the simulation-based variant introduced here. The two methods offer similar performance but only the simulation method retains good control of the type I error rate when circular data is rounded to a finite set of values (likely due to limited precision of measuring equipment). Adoption of the simulation variant will substantially improve the reliability of this regularly-used test in the commonplace situation where data values are rounded.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  9     Total Times Cited:  9     Cited Reference Count:  13 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: included in survey",10.1186/s40462-019-0160-x     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Circular statistics;Limited precision;Rayleigh test;Testing for circular uniformity;Randomisation testing;Statistical power;Oriana,,

We investigated these three general statistical approaches for trait-environment associations: CWMr, five weighted correlation metrics (Peres-Neto, Dray, & ter Braak, Ecography, 40, 806-816, 2017), and two multilevel models (MLM) using four different methods for computing p-values. We first compared the methods applied to a plant community dataset. To determine the validity of the statistical conclusions, we then performed a simulation study. CWMr gave highly significant associations for both traits, whereas the other methods gave a mix of support. CWMr had inflated type I errors for some simulation scenarios, implying that the significant results for the data could be spurious. The weighted correlation methods had generally good type I error control but had low power. One of the multilevel models, that from Jamil, Ozinga, Kleyer, and ter Braak (Journal of Vegetation Science, 24, 988-1000, 2013) had both good type I error control and high power when an appropriate method was used to obtain p-values. In particular, if there was no correlation among species in their abundances among sites, a parametric bootstrap likelihood ratio test (LRT) gave the best power. When there was correlation among species in their abundances, a conditional parametric LRT had correct type I errors but had lower power. There is no overall best method for identifying trait-environment associations. For the simple task of testing associations between single environmental variables and single traits, the weighted correlations with permutation tests all had good type I error control, and their ease of implementation is an advantage. For the more complex task of multivariate analyses and model fitting, and when high statistical power is needed, we recommend MLM2 (Jamil et al., 2013). However, care must be taken to ensure against inflated type I errors for both weighted correlations and MLM2. Because CWMr exhibited highly inflated type I error rates, it should always be avoided.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  50     Total Times Cited:  50     Cited Reference Count:  29 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/2041-210X.13119     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),community assembly;ecological community;environmental gradients;fourth-corner approach;generalized linear mixed models;hierarchical models;species niche centroid;Whittaker Siskiyou Mountains data;ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIPS,,

Here, we compare the statistical performances of different types of SWMs (distance-based or graph-based) in contrasted realistic simulation scenarios. Then, we present an optimization method and evaluate its performances compared to the arbitrary choice of the most-widely used distance-based SWM.

The optimization method, using a correction procedure for multiple tests, had a correct type I error rate, and had higher power and accuracy than an arbitrary choice of the SWM. Nevertheless, the power decreased when too many SWMs were compared, resulting in a trade-off between the gain of accuracy and the loss of power.

This situation invites the development of new methods capable of using all observation levels. To this end, new multilevel and weighted averaging-based regression methods are proposed. Compared to existing methods, the new multilevel method, called MLM3, has additional site-related random effects; they represent the unknowns in the environment that interact with the trait. The new weighted averaging method combines site-level CWMr with a species-level regression of Species Niche Centroids on to the trait. Because species can vary enormously in frequency and abundance giving diversity variation among sites, the regressions are weighted by Hill's effective number (N-2) of occurrences of each species and the N-2-diversity of a site, and are subsequently combined in a sequential test procedure known as the max test. Using the test statistics of these new methods, the permutation-based max test provides strong statistical evidence for trait-environment association in a plant community dataset, where existing methods show weak evidence. In simulations, the existing multilevel model showed bias and type I error inflation, whereas MLM3 did not. Out of the weighted averaging-based regression methods, the N-2-weighted version best controlled the type I error rate. MLM3 was superior to the weighted averaging-based methods with up to 30% more power.

Multiscale codependence analysis (MCA) quantifies the joint spatial distribution of a pair of variables in order to provide a spatially explicit assessment of their relationships to one another. For the sake of simplicity, the original definition of MCA only considered a single response variable (e.g. a single species). However, that definition would limit the application of MCA when many response variables are studied jointly, for example when one wants to study the effect of the environment on the spatial organisation of a multi-species community in an explicit manner.        2. In the present paper, we generalise MCA to multiple response variables. We conducted a simulation study to assess the statistical properties (i.e. type I error rate and statistical power) of multivariate MCA (mMCA) and found that it had honest type I error rate and sufficient statistical power for practical purposes, even with modest sample sizes. We also exemplified mMCA by applying it to two ecological datasets.        3. The simulation study confirmed the adequacy of mMCA from a statistical standpoint: it has honest type I error rates and sufficient power to be useful in practice. Using mMCA, we were able to detect variation in fish community structure along the Doubs River (in France), which was associated with large spatial structures in the variation of physical and chemical variables related to water quality. Also, mMCA usefully described the spatial variation of an Oribatid mite community structure associated with a gradient of water content superimposed on various smaller-scale spatial features associated with vegetation cover in the peat blanket surrounding Lac Geai (in Quebec, Canada).        4. In addition to demonstrating the soundness of mMCA in theory and practice, we further discuss the strengths and assumptions of mMCA and describe other potential scenarios where it would be helpful to biologists interested in assessing influence of environmental conditions on community structure in a spatially explicit way.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  30 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1111/2041-210X.12864     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),habitat modelling;scale;scale-dependent correlation;spatial model,,

Hubbell's neutral model is an important contribution to the exploration of community dynamics, both technically and philosophically. However, the neutrality tests for this model are limited by a lack of statistical power, partly because the zero-sum assumption of the model is unrealistic. In this study, we developed a neutrality test for local communities that implements non-zero-sum community dynamics and determines the number of new species (N-sp) between observations. For the non-zero-sum neutrality test, the model distributed the expected N-sp, as calculated by extensive simulations, which allowed us to investigate the neutrality of the observed community by comparing the observed N-sp with distributions of the expected N-sp derived from the simulations. For this comparison, we developed a new ""non-zero-sum N-sp test,"" which we validated by running multiple neutral simulations using different parameter settings. We found that the non-zero-sum N-sp test rejected neutrality at a near-significance level, which justified the validity of our approach. For an empirical test, the non-zero-sum N-sp test was applied to real tropical tree communities in Panama and Malaysia. The non-zero-sum N-sp test rejected neutrality in both communities when the observation interval was long and N-sp was large. Hence, the non-zero-sum N-sp test is an effective way to examine neutrality and has reasonable statistical power to reject the neutral model, especially when the observed N-sp is large. This unique and simple approach is statistically powerful, even though it only employs two temporal sequences of community data. Thus, this test can be easily applied to existing datasets. In addition, application of the test will provide significant benefits for detecting changing biodiversity under climate change and anthropogenic disturbance.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  0     Total Times Cited:  0     Cited Reference Count:  36 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not a simulation study",10.1002/ece3.8462     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Barro Colorado Island;immigration;local birth rate per death;neutral model;number of new species;Pasoh;SPECIES ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTIONS;SAMPLING FORMULA;MODELS;NICHE;ASSUMPTION;MECHANISMS;DIVERSITY;DYNAMICS;Trees,,

Social network methods have become a key tool for describing, modelling and testing hypotheses about the social structures of animals. However, due to the non-independence of network data and the presence of confounds, specialised statistical techniques are often needed to test hypotheses in these networks. Datastream permutations, originally developed to test the null hypothesis of random social structure, have become a popular tool for testing a wide array of null hypotheses in animal social networks. In particular, they have been used to test whether exogenous factors are related to network structure by interfacing these permutations with regression models.        2. Here, we show that these datastream permutations typically do not represent the null hypothesis of interest to researchers interfacing animal social network analysis with regression modelling, and use simulations to demonstrate the potential pitfalls of using this methodology.        3. Our simulations show that, if used to indicate whether a relationship exists between network structure and a covariate, datastream permutations can result in extremely high type I error rates, in some cases approaching 50%. In the same set of simulations, traditional node-label permutations produced appropriate type I error rates (similar to 5%).        4. Our analysis shows that datastream permutations do not represent the appropriate null hypothesis for these analyses. We suggest that potential alternatives to this procedure may be found in regarding the problems of non-independence of network data and unreliability of observations separately. If biases introduced during data collection can be corrected, either prior to model fitting or within the model itself, node-label permutations then serve as a useful test for interfacing animal social network analysis with regression modelling.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  38     Total Times Cited:  38     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: included in survey",10.1111/2041-210X.13508,group living;null hypothesis significance testing;null model;permutation test;randomisations;regression;social networks;Animals;Social Support;Animal Shells,,

Multivariate statistical methods are optimal to analyze such data and are thus frequently used in ecology for exploration, visualization, and inference. Most approaches are based on pairwise distance matrices instead of the sites-by-species matrix, which stands in stark contrast to univariate statistics, where data models, assuming specific distributions, are the norm. However, through advances in statistical theory and computational power, models for multivariate data have gained traction. Systematic simulation-based performance evaluations of these methods are important as guides for practitioners but still lacking. Here, we compare two model-based methods, multivariate generalized linear models (MvGLMs) and constrained quadratic ordination (CQO), with two distance-based methods, distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). We studied the performance of the methods to discriminate between causal variables and noise variables for 190 simulated data sets covering different sample sizes and data distributions. MvGLM and dbRDA differentiated accurately between causal and noise variables. The former had the lowest false-positive rate (0.008), while the latter had the lowest false-negative rate (0.027). CQO and CCA had the highest false-negative rate (0.291) and false-positive rate (0.256), respectively, where these error rates were typically high for data sets with linear responses. Our study shows that both model- and distance-based methods have their place in the ecologist's statistical toolbox.

However, the CWM approach does not yield valid tests, as random traits (or random indicator values) are far too often judged significantly related to the environmental variable, even when the trait and environmental variable are extrinsic to (not derived from) the community data. Existing solutions are the ZS-modified test (Zeleny & Schaffers,) and the max (or sequential) test based on the fourth-corner correlation. Both tests are based on permutations which become cumbersome when many tests need to be carried out and many permutations are required, as in methods that correct for multiple testing. The main goal of this study was to compare these existing permutation-based solutions and to develop a quick and easy parametric test that can replace them.        MethodsResultsThis study decomposes the fourth-corner correlation in two ways, which suggests a simple parametric approach consisting of assessing the significances of two linear regressions, one plot-level test as in the CWM approach and one species-level test, the reverse of the CWM approach, that regresses the environmental mean per species (i.e. the species niche centroid) on to the trait. The tests are combined by taking the maximum p-value. The type I error rates and power of this parametric max test are examined by simulation of one- and two-dimensional Gaussian models and log-linear models.        The ZS-modified test and the fourth-corner max test are conservative in different scenarios, the ZS-modified test being even more conservative than the fourth-corner. The new parametric max test is shown to control the type I error and has equal or even higher power than permutation tests based on the fourth-corner, the ZS-modified test and variants thereof. A weighted version of the new test showed inflated type I error.        ConclusionThe combination of two simple regressions is a good alternative to the fourth-corner and the ZS-modified test.

However, while these pure fractions can be tested using a classical residuals permutation procedure, no specific method has been developed to test the shared space-environment fraction (SSEF). Yet, the SSEF is expected to encompass a major driver of community assembly, that is, an induced spatial dependence effect (ISD; i.e. the reflection of a spatially structured habitat filter on a species distribution). A reliable test of this fraction is therefore crucial to properly test the presence of an ISD on ecological data. To bridge the gap, we propose to test the SSEF through spatially-constrained null models: torus-translations, and Moran spectral randomisations. We investigated the type I error rate and statistical power of our method based on two real environmental datasets and simulations of tree distributions. Ten types of tree distribution displaying contrasted aggregation properties were simulated, and their abundances were sampled in 153 regularly-distributed 20 x 20 m quadrats. The SSEF was tested for 1000 simulated tree distributions either unrelated to the environment, or filtered by environmental variables displaying contrasting spatial structures. The method proposed provided a correct type I error rate (< 0.05). The statistical power was high (> 0.9) when abundances were filtered by an environmental variable structured at broad scale. However, the spatial resolution allowed by the sampling design limited the power of the method when using a fine-scale filtering variable. This highlighted that an ISD can be properly detected providing that the spatial pattern of the filtering process is correctly captured by the sampling design of the study.

However, this fundamental hypothesis might be flawed because of phylogenetic relatedness between species and spatial autocorrelation in the environmental data. Here, using a simulation-based experiment, we demonstrate how the presence of spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelations can, in some circumstances, lead to inflated type I error rates, suggesting that significant associations can be misidentified. As an alternative, we propose a new randomization approach designed to avoid this issue, based on Moran's spectral randomization. In this approach, standard permutations are replaced by constrained randomizations so that the distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis is built with additional constraints to preserve the phylogenetic and spatial structures of the observed data.

Results from a pilot study may be extrapolated by simulation to predict the effectiveness of different configurations of multiple detectors, but simulation is slow and requires technical expertise. Another approach for evaluating novel designs is to compute intermediate variables such as the expected number of detected individuals E(n) and expected number of recapture events E(r), and to seek relationships between these variables and quantities of interest such as precision and power. We present formulae for the expected counts and power. For many scenarios the relative standard error (RSE) of estimated density is close to 1/min{E(n),E(r)}, and for maximum precision E(n) approximate to E(r). We compare the approximation for RSE(D<^>) with more rigorous results from simulation.

The presence of foxes in Tasmania is a contentious issue with recent structured monitoring efforts, involving collection of carnivore scats and testing for fox DNA, failing to detect any evidence of foxes. Understanding the likelihood that monitoring efforts would detect fox presence, given at least one is present, is therefore critical for understanding the role of scat monitoring for informing the response to an incursion. We undertook trials to estimate the probability of fox scat detection through monitoring by scat-detector dogs and person searches and used this information to critically evaluate the power of scat monitoring efforts for detecting foxes in the Tasmanian landscape. The probability of detecting a single scat present in a 1-km(2) survey unit was highest for scat-detector dogs searches (0.053) compared with person searches ((x) over bar congruent to 0.015) for each 10km of search effort. Simulation of the power of recent scat monitoring efforts undertaken in Tasmania from 2011 to 2015 suggested that single foxes would have to be present in at least 20 different locations or fox breeding groups present in at least six different locations, in order to be detected with a high level of confidence (>0.80). We have shown that highly structured detection trials can provide managers with the quantitative tools needed to make judgments about the power of large-scale scat monitoring programs. Results suggest that a fox population, if present in Tasmania, could remain undetected by a large-scale, structured scat monitoring program. Therefore, it is likely that other forms of surveillance, in conjunction with scat monitoring, will be necessary to demonstrate that foxes are absent from Tasmania with high confidence.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  7     Total Times Cited:  8     Cited Reference Count:  53 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not statistical method",10.1002/ece3.3694     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Bayesian analysis;detection probability;predator feces;scats;survival analysis;trace DNA;Vulpes vulpes;DETECTION DOGS;VULPES-VULPES;DNA DETECTION;ERADICATION;MODEL;ISLAND;SEARCH;ALLOCATION;SUCCESS;ABSENCE;Tasmania,,

We selected four diversity indices including species richness, Shannon-Wiener, Simpson and Pielou, and relative importance values to quantify community assembly and biodiversity. Empirical cumulative distribution and species accumulation curves were utilized to describe the SADs of two forests communities trees. Three types of models, including statistic model (lognormal and logseries model), niche model (broken-stick, niche preemption, and Zipf-Mandelbrodt model), and neutral theory model, were estimated by the fitted SADs. Simulation effects were tested by Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results found that the Fagaceae and Anacardiaceae families were their respective dominance family in the evergreen broad-leaved and deciduous mixed communities. According to original data and random sampling predictions, the SADs were hump-shaped for intermediate abundance classes, peaking between 8 and 32 in the evergreen broad-leaved community, but this maximum increased with size of total sampled area size in the deciduous mixed community. All niche models could only explain SADs patterns at smaller spatial scales. However, both the neutral theory and purely statistical models were suitable for explaining the SADs for secondary forest communities when the sampling plot exceeded 40 m. The results showed the SADs indicated a clear directional trend toward convergence and similar predominating ecological processes in two typical subtropical secondary forests. The neutral process gradually replaced the niche process in importance and become the main mechanism for determining SADs of forest trees as the sampling scale expanded.

Ignoring sampling uncertainty might lead to biased estimation of the strength of density dependence. This is typically addressed using state-space model approaches, which integrate sampling error and population process estimates. Such models seldom include an explicit link between the sampling procedures and the true abundance, which is common in capture-recapture settings. However, many of the models proposed to estimate abundance in the presence of capture heterogeneity lead to incomplete likelihood functions and cannot be straightforwardly included in state-space models. We assessed the importance of estimating sampling error explicitly by taking an intermediate approach between ignoring uncertainty in abundance estimates and fully specified state-space models for density-dependence estimation based on autoregressive processes. First, we estimated individual capture probabilities based on a heterogeneity model for a closed population, using a conditional multinomial likelihood, followed by a Horvitz-Thompson estimate for abundance. Second, we estimated coefficients of autoregressive models for the log abundance. Inference was performed using the methodology of integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). We performed an extensive simulation study to compare our approach with estimates disregarding capture history information, and using R-package VGAM, for different parameter specifications. The methods were then applied to a real data set of gray-sided volesMyodes rufocanusfrom Northern Norway. We found that density-dependence estimation was improved when explicitly modeling sampling error in scenarios with low process variances, in which differences in coverage reached up to 8% in estimating the coefficients of the autoregressive processes. In this case, the bias also increased assuming a Poisson distribution in the observational model. For high process variances, the differences between methods were small and it appeared less important to model heterogeneity.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  5     Total Times Cited:  5     Cited Reference Count:  50 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: included in survey",10.1002/ece3.6642,abundance;capture probability;closed population models;density dependence;INLA;process variance;ESTIMATING DENSITY-DEPENDENCE;TIME-SERIES;MODELS;CYCLES;FLUCTUATIONS;COMPLEXITY;INFERENCE;SURVIVAL;VOLES;BIAS;Animal Shells;Animals,,

We distinguish fully randomized experiments in which all treatments are applied to all species from those experiments in which the factor of interest varies at the species level, that is, treatments are not randomly allocated to species. In this latter case, the distribution of the experimental factor across species may be random, phylogenetically structured or species may be chosen in order to phylogenetically balance the sample (e.g. through sister-species comparisons). We show using simulations that the design of the experiment in terms of the phylogenetic distribution of the treatment can affect power and Type I error, and that commonly used approaches (Linear Mixed Models and ANOVAs) may have poor statistical properties (high Type I errors) when both the predictors and response data show strong phylogenetic signal.

Bayesian approaches in particular offer tremendous flexibility for SCR modeling. Increasingly, SCR data are being collected over very large spatial extents making analysis computational intensive, sometimes prohibitively so. To mitigate the computational burden of large-scale SCR models, we developed an improved formulation of the Bayesian SCR model that uses local evaluation of the individual state-space (LESS). Based on prior knowledge about a species' home range size, we created square evaluation windows that restrict the spatial domain in which an individual's detection probability (detector window) and activity center location (AC window) are estimated. We used simulations and empirical data analyses to assess the performance and bias of SCR with LESS. LESS produced unbiased estimates of SCR parameters when the AC window width was >= 5 sigma (sigma: the scale parameter of the half-normal detection function), and when the detector window extended beyond the edge of the AC window by 2 sigma. Importantly, LESS considerably decreased the computation time needed for fitting SCR models. In our simulations, LESS increased the computation speed of SCR models up to 57-fold. We demonstrate the power of this new approach by mapping the density of an elusive large carnivore-the wolverine (Gulo gulo)-with an unprecedented resolution and across the species' entire range in Norway (> 200,000 km(2)). Our approach helps overcome a major computational obstacle to population and landscape-level SCR analyses. The LESS implementation in a Bayesian framework makes the customization and fitting of SCR accessible for practitioners working at scales that are relevant for conservation and management.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  15     Total Times Cited:  15     Cited Reference Count:  37 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: included in survey",10.1002/ece3.4751     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),computation speed;local evaluation of the state-space;spatial capture-recapture;wolverines;POPULATION;MODELS;INFERENCE,,

Quantifying habitat availability over large spatial scales is, however, challenging. Although remote sensing techniques have high spatial coverage, there is uncertainty associated with these estimates due to errors in classification. Alternatively, the extent of habitats can be estimated from ground-based field survey. Financial and logistical constraints mean that on-the-ground surveys have much lower coverage, but they can produce much higher quality estimates of habitat extent in the areas that are surveyed. Here, we demonstrate a new combined model which uses both types of data to produce unified national estimates of the extent of four key habitats across Great Britain based on Countryside Survey and Land Cover Map. This approach considers that the true proportion of habitat per km(2) (Z(i)) is unobserved, but both ground survey and remote sensing can be used to estimate Z(i). The model allows the relationship between remote sensing data and Z(i) to be spatially biased while ground survey is assumed to be unbiased. Taking a statistical model-based approach to integrating field survey and remote sensing data allows for information on bias and precision to be captured and propagated such that estimates produced and parameters estimated are robust and interpretable. A simulation study shows that the combined model should perform best when error in the ground survey data is low. We use repeat surveys to parameterize the variance of ground survey data and demonstrate that error in this data source is small.

The raw percentage of individuals in the sample (naive prevalence) is generally used for this purpose, but it is likely to be subject to two main sources of bias. First, the detectability of individuals is ignored; second, classification errors may occur due to some inherent limits of the diagnostic methods. We developed a hidden Markov (also known as multievent) capture-recapture model to estimate prevalence in free-ranging populations accounting for imperfect detectability and uncertainty in individual's classification. We carried out a simulation study to compare naive and model-based estimates of prevalence and assess the performance of our model under different sampling scenarios. We then illustrate our method with a real-world case study of estimating the prevalence of wolf (Canis lupus) and dog (Canis lupus familiaris) hybrids in a wolf population in northern Italy. We showed that the prevalence of hybrids could be estimated while accounting for both detectability and classification uncertainty. Model-based prevalence consistently had better performance than naive prevalence in the presence of differential detectability and assignment probability and was unbiased for sampling scenarios with high detectability. We also showed that ignoring detectability and uncertainty in the wolf case study would lead to underestimating the prevalence of hybrids. Our results underline the importance of a model-based approach to obtain unbiased estimates of prevalence of different population segments.

We develop a new model to estimate age-dependent survival probabilities from such historical data when age at ringing is not recorded; we call this the historical data model.

Simulation studies show that the approach of Robinson, 2010, Ibis, 152, 651-795 can cause bias in parameter estimates. In contrast, the historical data model yields similar parameter estimates to the standard model. Parameter redundancy results show that the newly developed historical data model is comparable to the standard ring-recovery model, in terms of which parameters can be estimated, and has fewer identifiability issues than the conditional model. We illustrate the new proposed model using Blackbird and Sandwich Tern data.

However, a hidden cost of using ARU data for modeling species occupancy is that prohibitive amounts of human verification may be required to correct species identifications made from automated software. Bat acoustic studies exemplify this challenge because large volumes of echolocation calls could be recorded and automatically classified to species. The standard occupancy model requires aggregating verified recordings to construct confirmed detection/non-detection datasets. The multistep data processing workflow is not necessarily transparent nor consistent among studies. We share a workflow diagramming strategy that could provide coherency among practitioners. A false-positive occupancy model is explored that accounts for misclassification errors and enables potential reduction in the number of confirmed detections. Simulations informed by real data were used to evaluate how much confirmation effort could be reduced without sacrificing site occupancy and detection error estimator bias and precision. We found even under a 50% reduction in total confirmation effort, estimator properties were reasonable for our assumed survey design, species-specific parameter values, and desired precision. For transferability, a fully documented r package, OCacoustic, for implementing a false-positive occupancy model is provided.

Evol.,8,19,9633-9645,"Plumb, JM",,English,,"US Geol Survey, Western Fisheries Res Ctr, Columbia River Res Lab, Washington, DC 20242 USA","High water temperatures can increase the energetic cost for salmon to migrate and spawn, which can be important for Snake River fall-run Chinook salmon because they migrate great distances (>500km) at a time when river temperatures (18-24 degrees C) can be above their optimum temperatures (16.5 degrees C). Average river temperatures and random combinations of migration and spawning dates were used to simulate fish travel times and determine the energetic consequences of different thermal experiences during migration. An energy threshold criterion (4kJ/g) was also imposed on survival and spawning success, which was used to determine how prevailing temperatures might select against certain migration dates and thermal experiences, and in turn, explain the selection for the current spawning phenology of the population. Scenarios of tributary use for thermal refugia under increasing water temperatures (1, 2, and 3 degrees C) were also run to determine which combinations of migration dates, travel rates, and resulting thermal experiences might be most affected by energy exhaustion. As expected, when compared to observations, the model under existing conditions and energy use could explain the onset, but not the end of the observed spawning migration. Simulations of early migrants had greater energy loss than late migrants regardless of the river temperature scenario, but higher temperatures disproportionately selected against a larger fraction of early-migrating fish, although using cold-water tributaries during migration provided a buffer against higher energy use at higher temperatures. The fraction of simulated fish that exceeded the threshold for migration success increased from 58% to 72% as average seasonal river temperatures over baseline temperatures increased. The model supports the conclusion that increases in average seasonal river temperatures as little as 1 degrees C could impose greater thermal constraints on the fish, select against early migrants, and in turn, truncate the onset of the current spawning migration.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  13     Total Times Cited:  13     Cited Reference Count:  47 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not statistical method",10.1002/ece3.4353     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),bioenergetics;spawning salmon;temperature-dependence;ONCORHYNCHUS-TSHAWYTSCHA;ENERGY-EXPENDITURE;SOCKEYE-SALMON;UPSTREAM MIGRATION;WATER TEMPERATURE;SUMMER STEELHEAD;METABOLIC POWER;LAKE-MICHIGAN;NEW-ZEALAND;COLUMBIA;Energy Metabolism,,

One desirable property of a phylogenetic estimator is that of statistical consistency, which means intuitively that as more data are collected, the probability that the estimated tree has the same topology as the true tree goes to 1. To date, consistency results for species tree inference under the multispecies coalescent (MSC) have been derived only for summary statistics methods, such as ASTRAL and MP-EST. These methods have been found to be consistent given true gene trees but may be inconsistent when gene trees are estimated from data for loci of finite length. Here, we consider the question of statistical consistency for four taxa for SVDQuartets for general data types, as well as for the maximum likelihood (ML) method in the case in which the data are a collection of sites generated under the MSC model such that the sites are conditionally independent given the species tree (we call these data coalescent independent sites [CIS] data). We show that SVDQuartets is statistically consistent for all data types (i.e., for both CIS data and formultilocus data), and we derive its rate of convergence. We additionally show that ML is consistent for CIS data under the JC69 model and discuss why a proof for the more general multilocus case is difficult. Finally, we compare the performance of ML and SDVQuartets using simulation for both data types.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  12     Total Times Cited:  12     Cited Reference Count:  31 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: not statistical method",10.1093/sysbio/syaa039     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Consistency;gene tree;maximum likelihood;multilocus data;hylogenetic inference;species tree;SVDQuartets;SEQUENCE DATA;MOLECULAR EVOLUTION;IDENTIFIABILITY;MODEL;Trees,,

A model extension using data augmentation allows inferring the total number of species in the community, including those completely missed by sampling (i.e., not detected in any survey, at any site). Here we investigate the robustness of these estimates. We review key model assumptions and test performance via simulations, under a range of scenarios of species characteristics and sampling regimes, exploring sensitivity to the Bayesian priors used for model fitting. We run tests when assumptions are perfectly met and when violated. We apply the model to a real dataset and contrast estimates obtained with and without predictors, and for different subsets of data. We find that, even with model assumptions perfectly met, estimation of the total number of species can be poor in scenarios where many species are missed (>15%-20%) and that commonly used priors can accentuate overestimation. Our tests show that estimation can often be robust to violations of assumptions about the statistical distributions describing variation of occupancy and detectability among species, but lower-tail deviations can result in large biases. We obtain substantially different estimates from alternative analyses of our real dataset, with results suggesting that missing relevant predictors in the model can result in richness underestimation. In summary, estimates of total richness are sensitive to model structure and often uncertain. Appropriate selection of priors, testing of assumptions, and model refinement are all important to enhance estimator performance. Yet, these do not guarantee accurate estimation, particularly when many species remain undetected. While statistical models can provide useful insights, expectations about accuracy in this challenging prediction task should be realistic. Where knowledge about species numbers is considered truly critical for management or policy, survey effort should ideally be such that the chances of missing species altogether are low.","Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:  39     Total Times Cited:  40     Cited Reference Count:  44 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Coralie""=>""Included""}",10.1002/ece3.4821     WE  - Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),data augmentation;detectability;imperfect detection;richness;species occupancy;Switzerland;IMPERFECT DETECTION;BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES;DIVERSITY;PROBABILITIES;BIODIVERSITY;ABUNDANCE;INFERENCE;SUBJECT;SIZE;BIAS;Occupations,,

Understanding how the transcriptome evolves is therefore a key priority in identifying mechanisms of adaptive change. However, in contrast to powerful models of sequence evolution, we lack a consensus model of gene expression evolution. Furthermore, recent work has shown that many of the comparative approaches used to study gene expression are subject to biases that can lead to false signatures of selection. Here we first outline the main approaches for describing expression evolution and their inherent biases. Next, we bridge the gap between the fields of phylogenetic comparative methods and transcriptomics to reinforce the main pitfalls of inferring selection on expression patterns and use simulation studies to show that shifts in tissue composition can heavily bias inferences of selection. We close by highlighting the multi-dimensional nature of transcriptional variation and identifying major unanswered questions in disentangling how selection acts on the transcriptome.
